# prework-study-guide
Study guide for storing bootcamp pre-work information
## Description

- This study guide was a tool created as a project to help me become more familiar with coding language and apps. 
- This assignment showed me helpful beginner information and introduced me to applications and language I'll use in this class. 
- The information I will use in this course can be found in this guide. It also helps remind me that I'm capable of learning new things that were once foreign to me.
- I learned the purpose of different coding languages (HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript) and how to communicate with my computer using those languages. I also learned the purpose of the websites I will use to work along with my peers on coding projects.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

## Installation

-First, the command line interface (CLI) was used to navigate the folders on the computer
-After a 'Bootcamp' folder was created, a zipfile was uploaded and accessed using the CLI and VS Code. A bare index.html and .png file were included.
-Following the guide provided on the Bootcamp Prework Modules, coding for a Prework Study Guide was added to the index.html
    -- Header information was added
    -- The .png image was added under the header
    -- Body information was added to the page, with subheaders and lists for each sub-category 
    -- A footer was added stating "I can code!"
-These changes were saved and the CLI was used to navigate to Git Hub to merge the new updates to the main branch. Once the modification were reviewed, the updates were pushed through.
-The same process followed for coding the CSS, which gave style and better graphics to the index.html. Following instructions from the prework modules, font sizes, font color, margins, and borders were added. The CSS file was saved and entered into the html.index. Again, the CLI was utilized to sync the changes to the main branch
-Finally, the JavaScript information was configured. This allowed for interaction with the console section when inspecting the webpage. A variable was created to store information on the topics HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The js-script was linked to the HTML.index so it could be accessed throught the browser page. These changes were synchronized to the main branch using the CLI and Git Hub
    -- While learning JavaScript, tools such as variables, for loops, and functions were programmed. The variable defined the topics with which we were list in the console. A for loop was created to help the function tool determine which text to prompt in the console. The function tool worked as the set of instructions that told the program which task to perform from the for loop

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
